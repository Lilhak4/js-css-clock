# JavaScript & CSS Clock
## 2 out of 30
This repository is part of an ongoing program created by Wes Bos to improve on various skills pertaining to javascript. Using browser contained functions for the seconds, minutes, and hours, we can attribute them to each css created line that represents the second, minute, and hour hand on the face of a clock. Simple project, but I learnt more about transformations regarding degress and how to access the browser time function to implement in the future if need be.
